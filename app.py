# --- Explanation Section ---
st.header("Understanding the Catch-Up Clause in Alternative Investments")
st.markdown("""
In alternative investments, particularly in private equity and hedge funds, the **catch-up clause** is a crucial component that defines how profits are distributed between the **Limited Partners (LPs)** and the **General Partner (GP)**. This application demonstrates the impact of this clause on GP returns.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Preferred Return:**  A hurdle rate that LPs must receive before the GP starts receiving performance-based compensation (carried interest). It's like an interest payment on the LP's investment.
- **Catch-up Clause:** After LPs receive their preferred return, the catch-up clause allows the GP to receive a proportionally larger share of the profits until they have 'caught up' to their agreed-upon carried interest split.
- **Carried Interest:** The share of profits that the GP receives as incentive compensation, typically after the preferred return and catch-up are satisfied.

This application visualizes two scenarios:
1. **With Catch-up Clause:** Demonstrates how the GP benefits from the catch-up clause after LPs receive their preferred return.
2. **Without Catch-up Clause:** Shows a more straightforward profit distribution without the catch-up mechanism.

By adjusting the investment parameters in the sidebar, you can observe how these clauses affect the GP's overall returns under different conditions.

**Chart Explanation:**
- The blue line represents the GP's return when the catch-up clause is in effect.
- The orange line shows the GP's return without the catch-up clause.
- Observe how the catch-up clause can significantly enhance GP returns, especially when the fund performance exceeds the preferred return.

**Key Observations:**
- When the fund performs well (LP returns are high), the catch-up clause leads to a higher GP return compared to the scenario without it.
- The catch-up clause is designed to incentivize the GP to achieve higher returns, as they are rewarded more significantly once the LP's preferred return is met.
