# Technical Specifications for Streamlit Application: Alternative Investment Features, Methods, and Structures

## 1. Application Purpose
The **"Alternative Investment Features, Methods, and Structures"** application is designed to educate users on the implications of the catch-up clause in investment agreements, particularly focused on General Partner (GP) returns. The application will enable users to understand how the catch-up clause affects GP returns through interactive visualizations, allowing for a comparison of scenarios with and without the catch-up clause.

## 2. Data Requirements

### Data Sources
- **User Inputs**: Investments parameters provided directly by users through the application interface.
- **Internal Calculated Data**: Derived from user inputs which will include calculated GP returns based on the catch-up clause.

### Data Formats
- Inputs: Numeric and percentage formats entered through Streamlit input components (e.g., sliders, text input).
- Outputs: Data generated for GP returns, which will be utilized for visualization.

### Preprocessing Steps
- Validation of user inputs to ensure they are within reasonable ranges (e.g., non-negative values).
- Conversion of percentage inputs into decimal format where necessary (e.g., `GP preferred return %` as `0.08` for `8%`).

### Storage Needs
- Temporary storage of user inputs and calculated GP returns within the session state provided by Streamlit.
- Title and basic metadata for saved graphical outputs.

## 3. Functional Features

### Core Features and Functionalities
1. **User Input Form**:
   - Input fields for:
     - Total investment amount (numeric input)
     - Investment period (integer input)
     - GP preferred return percentage (slider or text input)
     - Catch-up percentage (slider)
     - LP returns (text input)

2. **GP Return Scenarios**:
   - Backend calculations to determine GP returns both with and without the catch-up clause.
   - Use of mathematical formulas based on inputs:
     - Include calculations for preferred returns and distributions.

3. **Visualization Results**:
   - Generation of two separate graphs showing GP returns with and without the catch-up clause.
   - Comparison analysis through annotations highlighting key differences.

4. **Downloadable Reports**:
   - PDF report generation that incorporates user inputs and visual data for offline usage.

## 4. Visualization Details

### Specifications for Visual Elements
- **Graph Types**:
  - **Graph A**: Line chart demonstrating GP returns with a catch-up clause.
  - **Graph B**: Line chart showing GP returns without a catch-up clause.

### Interactivity
- Users can hover over data points on graphs for detailed values.
- Interactive legends to toggle display of specific data series if needed.

### Libraries to Use
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static visualizations.
- **Plotly**: For interactive visual elements, if more advanced interactivity is required.

## 5. Backend Requirements

### Computational Processes
- Implementation of algorithms to calculate GP returns based on provided inputs.
  - Consider scenarios that need different handling depending on the catch-up clause.
  
### Machine Learning Models or Algorithms
- No advanced machine learning algorithms required. Basic calculations based on defined investment formulas will suffice.

### Sample Calculation Logic
1. **Preferred Return Distribution**: Calculate preferred returns up to the specified GP limit.
2. **Catch-up Clause Logic**: Define how cash flows are distributed based on whether the clause is applicable.
3. **Return Calculation**: Aggregate totals for final GP return values for both scenarios.

## 6. Frontend Requirements

### Layout and Design Elements
- **Sidebar**: For user input fields, organized in a logical flow.
- **Main Area**: For displaying results, charts, and the downloadable PDF report link.
- **Responsive Design** to accommodate various screen sizes.

### Interactivity Needed
- Live updates of graphs upon parameter changes (dynamic re-rendering).
- User feedback on input (error messages when inputs are invalid).

---

## 7. Deployment Specifications

### Requirements for Hosting
- Consideration for deploying the application on platforms like Streamlit Sharing, Heroku, or AWS.
  
### Environment Setup
- Utilize Docker or a virtual environment for dependency management.
- Required libraries installation:
  - `streamlit`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `plotly`
  
### Scalability Considerations
- Ensure minimal load times for calculations by optimizing backend logic.
- Consider potential user load and the impact on server performance; scalable cloud services should be considered if high traffic is anticipated.
